# CS230-PROJECT-Memory-and-cache-optimization-for-SAT-Solvers
• Analysed performance of processor by changing replacement policies, prefetchers like Best Offset, Next-line prefetcher
and cache sizes of L1,L2 and LLC to find the best combination for SAT solver algorithms
• Designed and implemented code for multiple cache hierarchy policies, including Inclusion, Exclusion, and Noninclusion Non-exclusion (NINE) policy, and conducted comprehensive performance analysis.
